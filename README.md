# Regulations.gov Comment Analysis Pipeline

A modular pipeline for analyzing public comments from federal regulations using AI-powered theme and entity discovery.

## Overview

This tool processes public comments to:
1. **Load** comments from regulations.gov API or CSV bulk downloads
2. **Condense** verbose comments into structured bullet-point summaries
3. **Discover themes** - build a hierarchical taxonomy of topics discussed
4. **Discover entities** - identify organizations, programs, and concepts mentioned
5. **Score themes** - analyze stance alignment and generate narrative summaries per theme

## Installation

```bash
# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## Usage

All commands follow the pattern:
```bash
bun run src/cli.ts <command> <document-id> [options]
```

Or use the shorthand scripts:
```bash
bun run <command> <document-id> [options]
```

### 1. Load Comments

Load from regulations.gov API:
```bash
bun run load CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 100
```

Load from CSV file:
```bash
bun run load path/to/comments.csv --limit 500
```

Options:
- `--api-key <key>` - Regulations.gov API key (default: DEMO_KEY)
- `--skip-attachments` - Don't download PDF attachments
- `--limit <n>` - Stop after N comments
- `--debug` - Save all API responses to debug/

**PDF Text Extraction**: The system now automatically extracts text content from PDF attachments using `pdf-parse`, providing actual document content instead of placeholder messages.

### 2. Condense Comments

Generate condensed bullet-point versions:
```bash
bun run condense CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 100
```

Options:
- `--limit <n>` - Process only N comments
- `--retry-failed` - Retry previously failed comments
- `--debug` - Save prompts and responses

**Metadata Optimization**: The condensing process now uses streamlined metadata headers instead of redundant JSON blocks, improving prompt efficiency while maintaining essential context.

### 3. Discover Themes

Build hierarchical theme taxonomy:
```bash
bun run discover-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031
```

Options:
- `--limit <n>` - Use only first N condensed comments
- `--batch-limit <n>` - Word count to trigger batching (default: 200000)
- `--batch-size <n>` - Target words per batch (default: 150000)
- `--debug` - Save intermediate results

**Simplified Architecture**: Theme discovery now works with plain text responses instead of complex JSON structures, improving reliability and reducing parsing errors. The system automatically extracts multiple quotes per theme with proper citation tracking.

### 4. Discover Entities

Extract named entities and build taxonomy:
```bash
bun run discover-entities CMS-2025-0050-0031
```

Options: Same as discover-themes

### 5. Score Themes

Generate stance analysis and narrative summaries per theme:
```bash
bun run score-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031 --themes 1.1,2.3
```

Options:
- `--themes <list>` - Comma-separated theme IDs to analyze (e.g., "1.1,2.3,4.2")
- `--debug` - Save prompts and responses

**New Functionality**: Scores every comment against every theme in the hierarchy (1=directly addresses, 2=touches on, 3=does not address) with comprehensive validation to ensure complete coverage.

### 6. Summarize Themes

Generate detailed narrative summaries for themes:
```bash
bun run summarize-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031
```

Options:
- `--themes <list>` - Comma-separated theme IDs to analyze
- `--min-comments <n>` - Minimum comments required for a theme (default: 5)
- `--depth <n>` - Maximum theme hierarchy depth to summarize (default: 2)
- `--batch-limit <n>` - Word limit to trigger batching (default: 150000)
- `--batch-size <n>` - Target words per batch (default: 75000)
- `--concurrency <n>` - Number of parallel API calls (default: 3)
- `--debug` - Save prompts and responses

**Key Features**:
- Uses worker pool for parallel processing
- Only summarizes themes up to specified depth (e.g., "1.1" but not "1.1.1" at depth 2)
- Dashboard shows link to parent theme analysis for deeper themes

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── commands/          # CLI command implementations
├── lib/              # Shared utilities (database, comment processing)
├── prompts/          # AI prompt templates
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── cli.ts            # Main entry point

dbs/                  # SQLite databases (one per document)
debug/                # Debug outputs when --debug flag used
```

### Database Schema

Each document gets its own SQLite database in `dbs/<document-id>.sqlite` containing:

- `comments` - Raw comment data from regulations.gov
- `attachments` - PDF and other attachments with extracted text content
- `condensed_comments` - AI-generated summaries with progress tracking
- `theme_batches` - Theme discovery results stored as plain text
- `themes` - Parsed hierarchical theme structure with multiple quotes per theme
- `entity_taxonomy` - Discovered entity categories
- `comment_entities` - Entity annotations per comment
- `comment_themes` - Complete scoring matrix (every comment vs every theme)
- `theme_scoring_status` - Processing status and error tracking

### Key Features

1. **Progress Tracking** - All operations can be resumed if interrupted
2. **Failure Handling** - Failed items tracked separately, retry with `--retry-failed`
3. **Batching** - Automatic batching for large datasets (>200k words)
4. **Debug Mode** - `--debug` flag saves all intermediate artifacts
5. **Modular Design** - Each command is independent and can be run separately
6. **Enhanced PDF Processing** - Automatic text extraction from PDF attachments
7. **Multiple Quote Support** - Themes can reference multiple supporting quotes with proper citations
8. **Complete Theme Scoring** - Every comment scored against every theme with validation

### AI Processing Approach

- **Narrative Output**: AI generates narrative/markdown responses for better quality
- **Post-hoc Parsing**: Structured data is extracted from narratives after generation
- **Smart Merging**: When batching is required, custom merge prompts reconcile different organizational schemes
- **Single Task Focus**: Each prompt focuses on one task to maximize quality
- **Simplified Data Structures**: Removed complex JSON wrappers in favor of direct text processing

## Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Required for AI features (condense, discover-themes, discover-entities, score-themes)
- `REGSGOV_API_KEY` - For regulations.gov API (defaults to DEMO_KEY)

## Examples

### Full Pipeline

Run all steps at once:
```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
bun run pipeline CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Start from a specific step (e.g., step 3 = discover-themes)
bun run pipeline CMS-2025-0050-0031 --start-at 3

# With options
bun run pipeline CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit-total-comment-load 100 --debug --start-at 2

# With crash recovery (default: 10 max crashes)
bun run pipeline CMS-2025-0050-0031 --max-crashes 20
```

**Crash Recovery**: The pipeline automatically retries from the failed step if it crashes (e.g., due to API errors). It will retry up to `--max-crashes` times (default: 10) before giving up. Each retry waits 5 seconds before restarting.

Or run individual steps:
```bash
# Load first 1000 comments
bun run load CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 1000

# Condense all loaded comments
bun run condense CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Discover themes from condensed comments
bun run discover-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Extract entities
bun run discover-entities CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Score all themes
bun run score-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Summarize themes
bun run summarize-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031

# Build website
bun run build-website CMS-2025-0050-0031
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run any command with --debug to save artifacts
bun run condense CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 10 --debug

# Check debug/ directory for:
# - condense_<comment-id>_prompt.txt
# - condense_<comment-id>_response.txt
# - themes_<batch-id>_prompt.txt
# - themes_<batch-id>_response.txt
# - score_themes_<theme-id>_prompt.txt
# - score_themes_<theme-id>_response.txt
```

### Incremental Processing
```bash
# Process in batches over multiple runs
bun run load CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 100    # First 100
bun run load CMS-2025-0050-0031 --limit 100    # Next 100 (201-300)

# Retry failed condensing
bun run condense CMS-2025-0050-0031 --retry-failed

# Analyze themes incrementally
bun run score-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031 --themes 1.1,1.2  # First batch
bun run score-themes CMS-2025-0050-0031 --themes 2.1,2.2  # Second batch
```
